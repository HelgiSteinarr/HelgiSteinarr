### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning CS @ ReykjavÃ­k University.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently experimenting with integrating a modern JavaScript pipeline into a Django application to increase my knowledge of modern webapps.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything tech related!

- âš¡ Fun fact: Although my main focus for the last ~5years has been computer science related, my main hobby is getting my hands dirty working on cars and also scuba diving!
